# Uniwa MIPS
This repository contains the implementation in VHDL of the microprocessor MIPS for the course of Design of Digital Systems in University of West Attika.
Both the MIPS implementation and testbench are available along with graphs of the microprocessor and ALU controller.

## How to use
The VHDL code can be compiled using the Modelsim environment or **Visual Studio Code**.
This section will guide you on how to setup Visual Studio Code for VHDL. For compiling VHDL the `GHDL` compiler is been used along with the `GTKWave` wave image program.

### Windows
1. Download the `GHDL` compiler for windows [here](http://ghdl.free.fr/download.html) and run the setup. If the `GHDL` is not included in the `PATH` variable, include it manually so you can access the compiler from Windows Terminal.
2. In this tutorial the `GTKWave` program is used. Download `GTKWave` for Windows [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/files/gtkwave-3.3.90-bin-win64/gtkwave-3.3.90-bin-win64.zip/download). After download is completed unzip the file and place it at your preferred location. Add the `gtkwave64/bin` in the `PATH` variable to access `GTKWave` from the Windows Terminal.
3. Compile the .vhd files using:
